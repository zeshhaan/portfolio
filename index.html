        I'm a self-taught programmer (2018 - current) who loves writing code for
        solving human problems and taking part in building great products that
        would make our lives easier.

      <p>
        VueJS is my preferred frontend tool and I love many things about it. I
        recently started with Vue after parting ways with React. You can

        I have been building while exploring Vue 3. Coming from a design
        background, I also love hacking with CSS and designing great UIs.

        I am very obsessed with Functional Programing and loves writing F# code
        during my free time.

        I also help people launch their business with less time and effort using
        Webflow. You can
